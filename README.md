This is a repository for my rotation project at the Wray lab.

The repos directories:

data_output - data files generated from analyses (e.g. bigwig tracks, bam alignments)
data_raw - input data for analyses (e.g. fastq, count matrix etc)
docs - main docs are the log (overview description of analyses), and reading notes (e.g. will be reading on Orchestrating Single Cell Analyses).
results - output figures and/or markdown documents.
scripts
execution - "working space" directory, to run / try out different analyses.
other - misc
